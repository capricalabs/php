(This is the preferred method, but, if you wish, you may e-mail all the required information to us, as explained in our submission guidelines.)                    <br><br>                                          <span class="title">You should begin by preparing the following items:</span>                     <ul>                        <li>A short abstract (in ASCII).<br>                        <li>A single PostScript (or PDF) file containing the entire paper. The first page of the paper should include the title and the authors' names and email addresses.<br>                        <li>Optional files containing online appendices. PROJAS encourages authors to publish source code, experimental data, demonstrations, etc., in online appendices. However, these are normally not reviewed, so you need not submit them at this point unless there is some reason for the reviewers to see them.                        <li>If you are resubmitting a paper that has been previously reviewed, you can submit a description of the changes that you have made.                      </ul>                        This form consists of three parts. In the first part, you begin the submission process by answering some questions about your paper, to help the PROJAS editors understand the contribution of your paper. In the second section, you will be asked to enter the title of your paper, the names and address of the authors, the abstract, and other basic information. Once you have entered this information, the system will give you a chance to check it over and make any corrections you want. Finally, you will be asked to upload your PDF (or PostScript) file and any optional files. (Alternatively, you may e-mail the files to us.) The submission is not complete until you have filled out the entire form and received an e-mail acknowledgment from PROJAS.                    <br><br>                <div align="center"><input type="submit" class="submit" name="submit" value="Continue &raquo;" /></div></td>           </td>        </tr>    </table></form>

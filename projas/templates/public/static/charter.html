<h1>Editorial Charter</h1>

<p>PROJAS&#8217;s editorial board is dedicated to the rapid dissemination of important research results to the global AI community. The journal&#8217;s scope encompasses all areas of Artificial Intelligence, including automated reasoning, cognitive modeling, knowledge representation, learning, natural language, neural networks, perception, and robotics.</p>

<p>Articles published in PROJAS must meet the highest quality standards, as measured by originality and significance of the contribution.</p>

<p>Papers should describe work that has both practical and theoretical significance.  Authors must clearly articulate all claims, and support them by empirical experiments or theoretical analyses. When appropriate, we encourage authors to implement their work and demonstrate its utility on significant problems; any experiments reported should be reproducible. Papers describing systems should clearly describe the contributions or the principles underlying them.  Papers describing theoretical results should also discuss their practical utility. In general, it should be clear how the work advances the current state of understanding and why the advance matters. Papers should report on what was learned in doing the work, rather than merely on what was done.</p>

<p>Authors must clearly acknowledge the contributions of their predecessors.  If a paper introduces new terminology or techniques, it should also explain why current terminology or techniques are insufficient.</p>

<p>We encourage authors to be concise. Short, high-quality articles are welcome, in addition to the more lengthy articles that traditionally appear in AI journals.</p>

<p>PROJAS also publishes <em>research notes</em> and <em>survey articles</em>.  Research notes are very brief papers that extend or evaluate previous work.  Survey articles are tutorials or literature reviews that contribute an analysis or perspective that advances our understanding of the subject matter.</p>

<p>Submissions must be original. The work cannot have previously been published or pending publication in another journal, and submissions cannot be under review by any other forum. We will, however, publish work that has previously been reported in conferences or workshops. If the work has appeared in an &quot;archival&quot; conference, such as AAAI or IJCAI, we require that the submission substantively extend the conference paper.</p>

<p>Articles may be accompanied by online appendices containing data, demonstrations, instructions for obtaining source code, or the source code itself (if appropriate). We strongly encourage authors to submit such appendices along with their papers.</p>

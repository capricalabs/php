a Projas project:

    conf/
    cron/
    docs/
    inc/
        control/
        lib/
        object/
        view/
    jair.admin/
        images/
    jair.public/
        images/
    media/
    templates/
        forms/
        include/
        public/
    
The conf directory contains the configuration variables needed to connect to the database, and adapt the CMS
to your envronment. 

The cron directory is used for php scripts called from the command line, or a scheduler to run batch processes. 

The docs directory contains documentation on the Projas project. 

the inc directory contains the core of the back-end. The controllers integrate most of the business logic in the 
system. The lib files contain the core classes, which interact with the database, and provide other needed utilities. 
object contains a class, schema representation. These classes map the database to the object properties for automagical
sql creation. view contains methods which generate front-end code, from controller given data.

up w/the PROJAS project.
